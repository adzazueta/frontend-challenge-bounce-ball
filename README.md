# Frontend Developer Challenge: Bounce Ball

Welcome to the challenge for the Frontend Developer position! This README contains the challenge details and instructions for completing it.

## Project Description

The objective of this test is to evaluate your Frontend development skills, your ability to work with canvas, vectors and your logic. You are required to create a web application that meets the following requirements:

1. **Square Container**: There should be a square or rectangle in the center of the screen

2. **Ball Moving**: Inside the box, draw a ball that starts moving in a random direction when the page loads.

3. **Bouncing**: The ball should bounce off the edges of the box realistically, meaning its direction should change as if it were bouncing off a surface.

You can use any technology or framework of your choice to complete this test. What we will primarily evaluate is the thinking and creativity in the implementation of the solution.

Happy Coding!!!
